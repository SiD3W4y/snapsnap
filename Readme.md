# snapsnap: Snapshot fuzzing

Snapsnap is a project acting as a playground for experimenting with snapshot
fuzzing. Its goal is more to act as a toolbox to build fuzzers uppon than to
provide a generic fuzzer.

Currently the project is a WIP, is not documented and is truly not meant for
anything more than experimentation.
